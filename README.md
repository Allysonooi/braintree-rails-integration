Things you may want to NOTE:

* Have to click on the link in static/subscription to create subscription (with details in the CheckoutController)

* In the CheckoutController, the Rcheckout is false and untested.

* For checkout/rsubscription, the "r" is not capitalised as i do not know how to link to a page with Rsubscription.
